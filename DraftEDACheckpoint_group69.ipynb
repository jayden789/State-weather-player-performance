    "The debate over which state produces the best basketball players has long been a point of contention among Americans, with popular contenders including New York, California, and Florida. While previous research has attempted to answer this question, it has only focused on the socio-economic factors, such as the study by James Tompsett and Chris Knoester that focused extensively on the likelihood of high school athletes advancing to collegiate levels.<a name=\"cite_ref_1\"/>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note_1) Indicators of family socioeconomic statuses, athletic development and merit, academic expectations and knowledge, and school contexts were used to predict the likelihood of becoming a college athlete. It was shown that high school athletes with a stronger socioeconomic background are much more likely to become collegiate athletes. The correlation with this is clear but it still does not answer our question. Thus, we aim to investigate another less conventional variable that could help us identify the best basketball state - the average temperature of the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been studies in the past that have looked at the effect of environmental factors on active participation in physical activities. The paper titled \"Assessing the Effects of Weather Conditions on Physical Activity Participation Using Objective Measures\" by Catherine B. Chan and Daniel A. Ryan examines how different weather conditions influence physical activity levels.<a name=\"cite_ref_2\"/>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note_2) The study identifies weather as a significant barrier to physical activity, particularly focusing on how adverse conditions such as low temperatures, rain, and snow decrease participation. Using data from various demographic groups, the study highlights that physical activity levels are generally higher on warmer days and lower during inclement weather. We intend on extending this study into the context of basketball. Further, a study done by David Hancock, Matthew Vierimaa, and Ashley Newman revealed that communities with populations of 250,000-499,999 are talent hotspots for high-level competitive basketball. They explained that this is due to favorable infrastructure and social structure, but call for more research into other factors such as crime rates and green spaces. <a name=\"cite_ref_3\"/>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note_3)\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to examine the correlation between a state's average temperature and the number of Division I NCAA basketball players it generates between 2019 and 2024 and foresee that environmental factors such as average temperature would provide residents in those areas different, unequal opportunities for physical activity. Another factor that could come into play is sports culture. As sports are strongly integrated in cultures, we may also observe a change in the popularity of different sports due to weather and how accessible that sport is. The accessibility of a sport due to climate could potentially have an effect on the opportunities for training and skill development, further impacting on court performance down the line. Investigating how average temperatures in different states correlate with the emergence of Division I basketball players can offer valuable insights into the broader determinants of athletic success. \n",

    "We hypothesize that there will be a positive correlation between the average temperature of a state and the quantity of Division I NCAA basketball players generated between 2018 and 2023. Our rationale is that warmer climates may facilitate greater participation in outdoor sports activities, including basketball, thereby potentially leading to an increased number of talented athletes pursuing collegiate basketball opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we anticipate that states with higher average temperatures will exhibit a positive correlation with the skill level of Division I basketball players. Specifically, we expect that players hailing from states with warmer climates will demonstrate a higher combined average of points, rebounds, and assists over the season. This hypothesis is grounded in the notion that favorable weather conditions may provide athletes with more opportunities for training and skill development, ultimately enhancing their performance on the court."

    "- Dataset #1: This dataset covers average temperature by state measured in Fahrenheit from 1895 to 2024 on a monthly basis. It uses a unique code specified in the documentation found on their page that signifies key factors such as the state and year in consideration. The key variables in the dataset are the state, year, month, and temperature all of which are read as type object. All 50 states are included, the years span from 1895-2024, covering all 12 months, with the temperature on the Fahrenheit scale. This dataset is crucial as we will be able to extrapolate the yearly temperature average for each state from 2018-2023 via data wrangling/cleaning. This would involve using a dictionary to interpret the state codes, dropping the years we are not analyzing, and creating a column for the mean temperature over all 12 months. This can then be used to analyze the role the temperature plays in relation to our research question.\n",

Since we are only interested in which state the players are from, the only information we need to extract from this dataset is the number of players from each state in each season. This also aligns with our ethics and privacy commitments of removing identifiable personal information. The dataframe after cleaning consists of three columns: state, year, and count.\n",
