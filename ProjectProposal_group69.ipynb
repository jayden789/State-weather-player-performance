    "The relationship between socioeconomic background and athletic accomplishment is a divisive topic that has been debated in the news, on social media, and on the Internet for many years. When considering National Collegiate Athletic Association Divison I (NCAA D-I) basketball, understanding the correlation between wealth and the potential to become an athlete of this caliber could help in considering potential ways to provide an equal opportunity to people of all backgrounds that dream of playing sports at the collegiate level. The chance of earning scholarships as well is a life-changing gift that can come with this level of athletic achievement. According to a research conducted by James Tompsett and Chris Knoester on the “extent to which high school indicators of family socioeconomic statuses, athletic development and merit, academic expectations and knowledge, and school contexts predict the likelihood of becoming a college athlete” <a name=\"cite_ref_1\"/>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note_1), high school athletes with a stronger socioeconomic background are much more likely to become collegiate athletes. Kristen Hextrum also reached a similar conclusion: that college admissions is more likely to reward those who invest their capital in their children strategically, thus advantaging those who are more well-off financially.<a name=\"cite_ref_2\"/>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note_2) Our goal is to understand the impact of economic background on the potential number of future athletes in the United States. While we aim to answer the same question previously answered by Tompsett and Knoester, we hope to broaden the scope and observe an overall trend; compared to the previous study’s more comprehensive approach in analyzing multiple factors for a much smaller dataset (7810 students). Our research aims to understand this relationship by considering the real per capita personal income per state and the production of NCAA D-I basketball players.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a subtopic, something that piqued our interest was the role of environmental factors, particularly temperature, in the emergence of NCAA D-I basketball players specifically. Exploring the possibility that the temperature of specific places could impact why people choose to pursue basketball over other sports, such as ice hockey for example, can provide further insight regarding the number of Divison I basketball players. Since the impact of economic factors has been researched in many facets of college programs, we decided to explore temperature in different states as its impact remains relatively understudied. A study done by David Hancock, Matthew Vierimaa, and Ashley Newman revealed that communities with populations of 250,000-499,999 are talent hotspots for high-level competitive basketball. They explained that this is due to favorable infrastructure and social structure, but call for more research into other factors such as crime rates and green spaces.<a name=\"cite_ref_3\"/>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note_3) We foresee that environmental factors such as average temperature would provide residents in those areas different opportunities. As sports are strongly integrated in cultures, we may also observe a change in the popularity of different sports due to weather and how accessible that sport is. Investigating how average temperatures in different states correlate with the emergence of Division I basketball players can offer valuable insights into the broader determinants of athletic success as well as a possible reason behind selecting a specific sport.\n",

    "We hypothesize that there will be a positive correlation between real per capita personal income in a state and the number of Division 1 NCAA basketball players produced from 2012 to 2022. This hypothesis is based on previous research indicating that individuals from higher socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to pursue athletic endeavors at the collegiate level due to advantages in resources and opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "We also hypothesize that states with higher average temperatures will have a greater number of Division 1 NCAA basketball players produced from 2012 to 2022. Our reasoning is that warmer climates might facilitate more outdoor basketball activities throughout the year, leading to increased participation and talent development in the sport. Therefore, it is anticipated that states with higher average temperatures will likely produce more Division 1 basketball players compared to states with lower average temperatures."

Realistically it is unlikely that we will be able to obtain these in a state where we won't have to process any data, so we aim to look for datasets that include the needed information or include information that can help us derive what we need, for example average monthly temperature datapoints that can help us calculate the average yearly temperature.\n",

During this review, we will pay particulat attention to any potential biases in the composition of the datasets, such as underepresentation of certain demographic groups or regions, as well as any privacy concerns related to the inclusion of sensative or potentially identifiable information.\n",

    "Transparency: We will openly acknowledge any biases or limitations in the datasets, ensuring our analysis is conducted with full transparency and accountability. By providing clear documentation of our data sources, methodologies, and any assumptions made during the analysis, we will enable stakeholders to critically evaluate the findings and undetstand the context in which they were derived. We will scrutinize any potential biases in our datasets and methods, particularly socioeconomic biases that might influence or skew the analysis. The will make sure data accurately represent all demographics to prevent exclusion of lower-income populations. It is quite easy for machine learning algorithms to ignore the presence of bias in an attempt to uphold accuracy; however, if certain factors are ignored, the accuracy does not take a major hit and the predictions are not biased as well. Therefore, we attempt to fairly represent our dataset.\n",

    "Data Validation: We will validate the accuracy and integrity of the datasets through rigorous quality assurance measures, including data cleaning and verification procedures. This will involving checking for inconsistencies or errors, and implementing appropriate corrections to ensure the reliability of our analysis.\n",

    "Privacy Protection: We will prioritize safeguarding individuals privacy rights by adhering to relevant privacy regulations and guidelines, ensuring that any personally identificable information is handled with care and only used in accordance with ethical standards\n",
